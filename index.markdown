### Write-Up 1
"This visualization aims to showcase the geographic spread of reported Bigfoot sightings across the United States. Utilizing the latitude and longitude data from the BFRO reports dataset, each sighting is represented as a firebrick-colored circle on a map projection of the United States. The choice of the albersUsa projection was made to focus on the contiguous United States, where the majority of sightings are reported." In the Altair map visualization, we've used quantitative encodings for longitude, latitude, and the number of sightings (sightings_count), which dictate the placement and color of each sighting mark on the map. Nominal encodings are applied to state and county names, providing categorical information via tooltips. Together, these encodings effectively convey the geographical spread and relative frequency of Bigfoot sightings across different regions, making the visualization both informative and visually appealing.
In the map visualization, interactivity comes through the use of tooltips. As users hover over each sighting mark, a tooltip appears, displaying detailed information about the sighting, including the state, county, and the number of sightings in that location. This feature allows users to interact with the map directly and gain immediate insights into specific areas without overwhelming the visual field with information. It transforms a static geographic distribution into an exploratory tool where users can pinpoint areas of high sighting frequencies and discover patterns at a more granular level. The immediate feedback of the tooltip encourages users to navigate across different regions. In this visualization, we explore the geographic distribution of Bigfoot sightings, with the focus on varying the color intensity of marks based on the number of sightings reported within each area, without changing their size. This approach aims to provide a clear, uniform look at each sighting's location while allowing the color variations—from blue (fewer sightings) to orange (more sightings)—to narrate the story of Bigfoot sightings concentration across different regions.
In this Altair code, we added a dynamic coloring feature based on the sightings_count and introduced tooltips for interactive details on hover, as opposed to the Vega-Lite code where the mark size was fixed, and color was statically set to 'firebrick' without additional information on hover.

### Write-up 2
"This bar chart visualization represents the number of Bigfoot sightings reported each year, based on the dataset spanning several decades. By calculating and extracting the year from the sighting date and aggregating the number of reports per year, the chart provides a clear view of how sightings have varied over time." In the Altair visualization for the temporal distribution of Bigfoot sightings, quantitative encodings are applied to both the x-axis (year) and y-axis (count of sightings) to illustrate the trend over time. Nominal encodings are used within tooltips to display categorical information like the year, alongside the quantitative count of sightings. This combination of encodings, along with the interactive elements such as dropdown selections for years and highlighting on hover, provides a dynamic and detailed examination of the data, enriching the user's ability to explore and understand the temporal patterns of Bigfoot sightings.
The bar chart's interactivity enhances the temporal analysis of sightings through a combination of a dropdown menu and highlighting effects. The dropdown menu allows users to filter the data by year, providing a personalized view of the sightings' distribution over time. This selection tool caters to users' specific interests, enabling them to isolate periods of high activity or investigate year-to-year variations in sightings. The highlighting effect, activated upon hovering over a bar, serves to emphasize the selected year, making it easier for users to compare the number of sightings across different years visually. This interactivity not only aids in data interpretation but also transforms the viewer’s role from a passive observer to an active participant, engaging them in a hands-on exploration of the data.
In this Altair code, we introduced interactive elements such as a dropdown filter to select specific years and a highlight feature for hovering, which were not present in the original Vega-Lite code. Additionally, we handled the transformation of the date field to extract the year within the Python environment using pandas, rather than directly in the Vega-Lite specification, offering a more Pythonic approach to data preprocessing and enhancing interactivity in the visualization.
